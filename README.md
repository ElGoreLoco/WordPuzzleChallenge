WordPuzzleChallenge
===================
This is my contribution to the [WordPuzzleChallenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHappieMakers/comments/4bb8lp/game_dev_challenge_word_puzzles/).

## How to run it
Open a terminal (maximized or full-screen) in the project folder and run `gcc main.c ; ./a.out`.

It should work on Linux and Mac but I haven't checked on Mac.
